This file outlines the main components and some issues to consider of the program being made.

////////////
// Tetris //
////////////

First, this will be built standalone
	Input Handler will read from keyboard
	Only output will be to Display Manager

Game Logic:
	Threading and dealing with concurrency
	How often it should read from Input Handler
	How often it should write to Game State

Input Handler:
	What it will actually accept as input
	How it will tell Game Logic what the commands are

Game State:
	Will this be a data structure or will it do some work?


/////////////////////
// Display Manager //
/////////////////////

First will only display in ASCII - need to find an API that can help with that
Then this will be implemented with a graphics library (which I'll have to learn first)


////////////////
// Controller //
////////////////

First, this will be set up to read from the keyboard
Then it will be adjusted to connect with Player
